# Smart Room
This project is an embedded system created to make a room smarter with FreeRTOS. Smart Room uses sensors to measure temperature, humidity and luminosity of the room. If the temperature is not confortable, Smart Room turns on the air conditioner; if the humidity is not healthy, Smart Room turns on the humidifier; and if the luminosity is high enough, Smart Room opens the window(s) and activate the alarm to wake up the user in his room.

This system was developed with C++ and FreeRTOS.
